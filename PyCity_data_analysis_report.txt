PyCitySchool Data Analysis Report:

1. Top performing school(by % overall passing )  and Scores by school size:

* From the top 5 performing school data we can conclude that charter schools are performing well, because 
the size of the school is half compared to District school size.

* When you compare with the bottom performing school we can conclude the less performing schools are all District,
and the school size is double compared to Charter school. 

* So if the school size is large,the performance is low. 
If the school size is small the performance is good.
This is proved by Scores by school size summary data.

2.  Scores by school spending summary data:

* As per the Scores by school spending data, the school performance has no role in improving students score. 

3. Reading and Math score By grade data:

* As per this data all grades are performing well in Reading. 
* But Math score is having the variations by schols. 
* But each school math score is consistent through all grades(9th,10th, 11th and 12th)
